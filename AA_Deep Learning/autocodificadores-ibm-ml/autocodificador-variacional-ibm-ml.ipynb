The decoder then uses $\\boldsymbol z$ to generate the most likely reconstruction $\\hat X$.\n\nAt this point, a natural question that comes in mind is, how do we use VAEs to generate meaningful content? You might think that if we train a VAE on images, then we can use it to generate new images. However, since it's difficult to regularize what happens to our encoder output in the latent space, we can't be sure that the encoder will organize information in the latent space in a way that the decoder can easily take that information and generates content that seems reasonable.\n\nHence, in order to be able to use the VAE for meaningful generative purposes, we need to introduce some regularization into the latent space. As shown in the diagram below, **instead of mapping the input to a single point in the latent space, we encode it as a normal distribution by returning the mean and standard deviation of the distribution**. By doing so, the decoder would be able to use the regularized information to construct new content.\n\nIn the following sections, we will build a VAE by following the architecture in the illustrative diagram below.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" <center>\n    <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML311-Coursera/labs/autoencoder.png\"\" width=\"800\" alt=\"computer components\"  />\n<center>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Encoder Part\n\nWe build the encoder part by breaking it up into three smaller parts.\n\nThe **first part** of the encoder consists of several fully connected layers, as shown in the picture below, which encodes the high-dimensional input; For our implementation, we will use two **convolution layers** since we want the model to learn the image data using convolutions.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML311-Coursera/labs/encoder.png\" width=\"30%\" alt=\"computer components\"/></center>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here is the code for building the first part of the encoder.

To enforce this, we would need to use the ReLU activation to obtain such a value, but the gradient is not well defined around zero.\n*   Besides, since we typically apply normalization methods in model training, the data values range from 0 to 1, which means the standard deviation of those values is also very small.
